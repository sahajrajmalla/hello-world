<h1>The HTML &ltsvg&gt element

	The HTml &ltsvg&gt element is conatiner for SVG grahics.

	SVG has a several mrthods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text and grahics images.

	<h1>Difference Between SVG and Canvas</h1>

	SVG is a language for describing 2D prahics in XML
	Canvas draws 2d grahics ont he fly(with a javascript)

	Svg is XMl based, which means that every element is avaiable within svg dom. you can attach javascript event handler for an event.

	In SVG, each drwan shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG onject are changed, the browser canautomatically rerender the shape


	In SVG EAch drwan shape is remembered as an object. if attributes of an SVg object are changed , the browser automatically re-render the shape.

	Canvas is rendered pixel by piel. In the canvas, once th egraphic is drawn. it is forgotten by the broweserif its position is changed , the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any object that might have been covered by the grahics....

	COMPARISION of canvas and SVG

<h1>Playing Video in HTml</h1>
Before Html 5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug in like flash.

The HTMl5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed in a vdeo ina web page.


	the Html <video> element

		To show a video in HTML, use the video element.

		Example
		<video width="1003px" height="768px" controls>

		<source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="movir.ogg" type="video/ogg">
				YOur Browser does not Support the video tag
			</video>


			How it works


			The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause and volume.

			It is a good idea to always inlcude width and height attribute. IF the height and width are not set the page might flicker while the video loads.

			The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files while the browser may CHOOSE FROM THE BROWSER WILL USE the first recognized format.

				<source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser maychoose from the browser will use the first recognized format.

					The text bbetween the video and .video tags will only be displayed in browser that do not support the video element


					HTML <video> auto play

						<video width="1003px" height="768px" autoplay="autoplay">
							<source src="movie.mp4> type="video/mp4">
							your browser doesnot support the video</video>



</video>
</video>
</video>

<pre>
	HTML video- METHOD , properties and events


	HTml 5 defines the DOM methods, properties and events for the video element.

	This allow you to load , play,and pause video as well as setting duration and volume.
	There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begihns to play, is paused etc


	Example
	Using javascript...




AUDIO On the WEb

before HTML5, audio files could only be played in browser with the plugin like flash)

The HTml5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.



<audio width="1003px" height="50px" controls>
	<source src="littledoyouknow.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/>
	your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>


Html audio
How it works

The controls attribute adds audio controls like play pause volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may chosen from. the browser will use the first recognized format.

	tHE tEXT BETWENNTH <AUDIO> and </AUDIO> tags will only be displayed in browser when the audio in support in the browser.

	 the <source> element allows to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choosen fromthe browser sill use the first recognized format

	 	The <ource> element allows you to specify alternative audio fiels whcih the browser may choose 	from. the browser will use the first recognized format.

	 		The text between the audio  and /audio tag will only be displayed element.
